# Introduction #

CytoCluster is a Cytoscape app for analysis and visualization of clusters from network. Based on another Cytoscape2.X plug-in named ClusterViz, six different graph clustering algorithms (FAG-EC, HC-PIN, OH-PIN, IPCA, EAGLE and MCODE) were implemented in CytoCluster. This plug-in is developed by Tang Yu, and supported by Prof. Jianxin Wang and Dr. Min Li, from Central South University.
